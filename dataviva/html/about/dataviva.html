  <p>What is it? A analytical decision-making tool.</p>
  
  <p>Who is it for? Government, private sectors, and citizens.</p>
  
  <p>DataViva was a project started in August of 2012 by the Escritorio of 
    Minas Gerais in collaboration with a small start-up called Growth Ventures 
    based in Cambridge, MA. DataViva is a tool composed of a number of 
    applications, each of which visualize data in innovative and creative ways.

    government, private sectors, as well as citizens themselves be able to 
    understand big data and and more importantly, use it to their advantage.</p>
