<p>{% trans %}The eighth DataViva application aims to facilitate comparison between two different localities and works the same way as a scatter plot. Each locality compared occupies one of the axes of the graph and the values of selected variables are distributed in the same scale, creating a diagonal line where the values are equal. We can thus compare the values of the variables available between two localities (municipalities, regions and states) in a simple and visual way.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}One of the visualizations is a comparison of exports from Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, revealing that “Mineral Products” is a leading category for both states, with very similar values, since they are located near the diagonal line of the graph. Some other products like “Arts and Antiques” are exported significantly more by Rio de Janeiro state, while products such as “Precious Metals” are exported mostly by Minas Gerais.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}These comparisons can help with finding other reference localities or determining the most interesting localities for a particular investment or economic activities which are more concentrated in certain regions. Compare creates visualizations with the main variables available in DataViva (products, activities, occupations) and reveal or confirm hypotheses about differences or similarities in the variables selected between two Brazilian localities.{% endtrans %}</p>
