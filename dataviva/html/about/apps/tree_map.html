<h2>{% trans %}Year{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}The rectangles display data for a specific year in the dataset. By changing the year using the slider at the bottom of the app, the data associated with each rectangle will change to that new year’s data. This, in conjunction with using the play button to cycle through years, can provide helpful insights on how the data changes over time.{% endtrans %}</p>
