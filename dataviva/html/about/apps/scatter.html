<h1>Scatter</h1>

<div class="topic">
<p>A scatter plot is a collection of data positioned on a cartesian plane using 2 available variables. The default variables shown here are  <a href="/about/glossary/#distance">Distance</a> and Complexity.</p>

	<h2>Sizing</h2>
	<p>In a Scatter app, each circle has an area proportional to a specified dimension on the data. Our default sizing is Trade Value for product data and Total Number of Employees for employment data, but this value can be changed depending on the dataset. When changing this value, the circles on the page will resize accordingly.</p>

	<h2>Depth</h2>
	<p>By changing the depth shown, you can aggregate the circles to get a broad view of the Sectors, or go deeper to get a more granular look at the data.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Color</h2>
	<p>Color, along with the other visualizations, defaults to showing Sectors for the data classification you are viewing (whether it is products, industries, occupations, or locations). In some cases, the color may be manipulated to show other values, such as growth, complexity, or opportunity gain.</p>

	<h2>Hide RCA</h2>
	<p>When this toggle is turned on, only the items with RCA < 1 will be shown. This is helpful when looking at distances of potential new sectors. When this toggle is off, all items will be shown, and if not viewing at the deepest level, will show items of RCA >= 1 as percentage of the circle complete. Circles with RCA >= 1 are always shown filled in every app.</p>

	<h2>Filter/Solo</h2>
	<p>By using the key on the bottom of the page, you can remove (filter) or single out (solo) specific Sectors of circles. Click the “X” on the right of the key to clear all filters and solos.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Year</h2>
	<p>The circles are positioned in the chart based on data for a specific year in the dataset. By changing the year using the slider at the bottom of the app, the data associated with each circle will change to that new year’s data. This, in conjunction with using the play button to cycle through years, can provide helpful insights on how the data changes over time.</p>
