<h1>{% trans %}Stacked{% endtrans %}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The Stacked visualization allows analyzing the growth of a variable over time. Built as an area chart in which the height of each line represents its share in total or gross, this view follows the same color pattern of the other applications, facilitating the identification of large groups to which each item belongs. Therefore, this application facilitates an understanding of the growth patterns and trends of any of the variables available in DataViva.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}The purpose of this application is to allow the visualization of the data in a time series, revealing product, economic activities, occupations or localities with greater participation over time and its history of growth or decrease, either in gross or percentage. One of the visualizations, for instance, is for economic activities of Minas Gerais, revealing the overall growth of the state economy and which sectors had the greatest contribution to this growth since 2002.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}Like the other apps, you can modify the data displayed for any of the basic variables available in DataViva (products, activities, occupations) and their intersections with localities all over Brazil at different levels (state, region, municipality).{% endtrans %}</p>
