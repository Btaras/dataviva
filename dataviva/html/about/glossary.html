  <h2>Distance</h2>
  <p>Using the network visualization we can quickly see which industries, occupations or products are found in a given location. But what about the ones in which a location does not have RCA? Distance is the measure used to indicate how “far away” any given location is from a particular industry, occupation or product. The distance of a given item i to a location b is calculated as the sum of all the proximities between i and the other items that b has RCA < 1. This number is then normalized by dividing it by the sum of all items regardless of its RCA in location b. In speaking about exports, we would notice that if a particular product is connected mostly with products that a location does export, the distance value would be close to 0 (meaning it’s very close by!). The opposite being true if the interested product is connected with mostly products that are not exported, i.e. the distance value would be closer to 1. The equation can be found in this figure.</p>

  <h2>Importance</h2>
  <p>Each occupation, regardless of geographical location, has an importance value. This value is calculated by looking at the overall ubiquity of an occupation throughout every industry in Brazil. We take the number of locations with RCA in a given industry that also employ a given occupation, and divide that by the total number of locations with RCA in that given industry. Here is the calculation used (where y is a year, b is a location, i is an industry, and o is an occupation):</p>

  <p>The higher importance value an occupation has, the more common it is to that industry. This would generally mean that the occupation is more necessary. For example Cooks are much more important in the Restaurant industry than Accounting Assistants though they are both employed in that industry.</p>

  <h2>Economic Complexity (ECI)</h2>
  <p>Economic Complexity measures how diversified and complex a location’s export production is. It is calculated as the average complexity of the products’ complexities (or PCIs) that a location exports with RCA.</p>

  <h2>Opportunity Gain</h2>
  <p>Opportunity gain is a measure that indicates how much diversity is offered by an industry if the location develops the capacity become successful in that industry.</p>

  <h2>Proximity</h2>
  <p>This is the measure of distance between any two products, industries or occupations used to construct the network visualization e.g. industry space, occupation space and product space. The network app only shows the connections between nodes that have the highest proximity but in actuality every node has a proximity value with every other node.</p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Product Proximity</h3>
  <p>The product space network layout has been calculated using world trade data though any proximity values shown have all been calculated using only Brazilian export data (SECEX). It is important to note that any network graphic is really just an estimate of the underlying adjacency matrix used to create it. When viewing a specific Brazilian location, one is only seeing the products that said location is exporting. The way proximity is calculated for products is by counting the number of locations that export both products with revealed comparative advantage (RCA) and dividing that by the number of locations that export the most ubiquitous product of the pair. Let us take as a simple example 2 products: Cut Flowers (HS ID: 0603) and Honey (HS ID: 0409). As shown in the following figure, the proximity between these 2 products is ⅓.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h3>Location Proximity</h3>
  <p>The proximity measure used to measure how similar locations are is quite simply the inverse of the calculation used for the product space. The same matrix of products and locations is used. Below you will see an illustration of this calculation.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h3>Industry Proximity</h3>
  <p>The industry space is created a bit differently from the product space, in that instead of basing the RCA calculation matrix off of locations and industries, we are using a matrix of industries and occupations. The reason for this is that as opposed to product exports and location, similar industries do not necessarily tend to co-locate. Take for example two large industries such as auto part manufacturing and electronics manufacturing. The data has shown that such large industries do not tend to co-locate in similar areas, but instead in rural areas outside of urban centers isolated from many other industries. Yet by looking at the workforce shared between such industries we find many of the same occupations e.g. machine operators, production line feeders, electrical engineers.</p>

  <h3>Occupation Space Proximity</h3>
  <p>The proximity measure used for the occupation space is quite simply the inverse of the calculation used in the industry space. The same matrix of industries and occupations is used. Below you will see an illustration of this calculation.</p>

  <h2>Product Complexity (PCI)</h2>
  <p>Product Complexity is a measure of how complex a product is, based on how many countries export the product and how diversified those exporters are.</p>

  <h2>RCA</h2>
  <p>Revealed Comparative Advantage is a numeric value used to connote whether a particular product or industry is especially prominent in a location. The calculation for this number is a share of a share. Say for example we were to consider Belo Horizonte’s exports of Cars. We would take the share that Cars represent in Belo Horizonte’s export basket divided by the share that Cars represent in all of Brazil. If this number is larger than or equal to 1, we can say that Belo Horizonte is a strong exporter in Cars (stronger than the average). RCA is a much better indicator of whether a product or industry is expressed in a location rather than export value alone because it takes into account the size of the location’s market vis-a-vis the total market size.</p>

  <h2>Required Employees</h2>
  <p>To determine how many employees of a given occupation are required for a given industry in a given location, we find the top 20% of similar locations by Locational Proximity and take the average of those locations’ number of employees in an occupation per establishment. If a location already has RCA  1 we would just use their number for the recommended employment.</p>
