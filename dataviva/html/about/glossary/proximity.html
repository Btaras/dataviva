It is important to note that any network graphic is really just an estimate of the underlying adjacency matrix used to create it. When viewing a specific Brazilian location, one is only seeing the products that said location is exporting. The way proximity is calculated for products is by counting the number of locations that export both products with revealed comparative advantage (%(rca)s) and dividing that by the number of locations that export the most ubiquitous product of the pair.

Take for example two large industries such as auto part manufacturing and electronics manufacturing. The data has shown that such large industries do not tend to co-locate in similar areas, but instead in rural areas outside of urban centers isolated from many other industries. Yet by looking at the workforce shared between such industries we find many of the same occupations e.g. machine operators, production line feeders, electrical engineers.', rca = '<a href="/about/glossary/rca/">RCA</a>') }}
