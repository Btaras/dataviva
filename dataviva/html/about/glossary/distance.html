  {{ _('Using the %(network)s visualization we can quickly see which industries, occupations or products are found in a given location. But what about the ones in which a location does not have %(rca)s? Distance is the measure used to indicate how “far away” any given location is from a particular industry, occupation or product. The distance of a given item i to a location b is calculated as the sum of all the %(proximities)s between i and the other items that b has %(rca)s < 1. This number is then normalized by dividing it by the sum of all items regardless of its %(rca)s in location b. In speaking about exports, we would notice that if a particular product is connected mostly with products that a location does export, the distance value would be close to 0 (meaning it’s very close by!). The opposite being true if the interested product is connected with mostly products that are not exported, i.e. the distance value would be closer to 1. The equation can be found in this figure.', network = '<a href="/about/apps/network/">%s</a>' % (_("Network")), rca = '<a href="/about/glossary/rca/">RCA</a>', proximities = '<a href="/about/glossary/proximity/">%s</a>' % (_("proximities"))) }}
