<h1>RCA</h1>
<p>{% trans %}Revealed Comparative Advantage is a numeric value used to connote whether a particular product or industry is especially prominent in a location. The calculation for this number is a share of a share. Say for example we were to consider Belo Horizonte’s exports of Cars. We would take the share that Cars represent in Belo Horizonte’s export basket divided by the share that Cars represent in all of Brazil. If this number is larger than or equal to 1, we can say that Belo Horizonte is a strong exporter in Cars (stronger than the average). RCA is a much better indicator of whether a product or industry is expressed in a location rather than export value alone because it takes into account the size of the location’s market vis-a-vis the total market size.{% endtrans %}</p>
