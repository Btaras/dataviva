<h2>Network</h2>
<p>The Network app displays data points as a fixed layout of nodes and their connections, based on the selected dataset. The connections and node positions are calculated based off of their <a href="/about/glossary/#proximity">Proximity</a> with eachother.</p>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Sizing</h2>
	<p>In a Network, each circle has an area proportional to a specified dimension on the data. Our default sizing is Trade Value for product data and Wages Paid for employment data, but this value can be changed depending on the dataset. When changing this value, the circles on the page will resize accordingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Highlight RCA</h2>
	<p>The circles in the network are colored in if the current location has competitive advantage in that field. By turning on the “Highlight RCA” toggle, the items that do not have <a href="/about/glossary/#rca">RCA</a> fade to grey.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>RCA Scope</h2>
	<p>When looking at Product Export data, you can change the RCA calculation from using internal domestic comparisons (SECEX) to using international world trade comparisons (COMTRADE).</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Color</h2>
	<p>Color, along with the other visualizations, defaults to showing Sectors for the data classification you are viewing (whether it is products, industries, occupations, or locations). In some cases, the color may be manipulated to show other values, such as growth, complexity, or opportunity gain.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Filter/Solo</h2>
	<p>By using the key on the bottom of the page, you can remove (filter) or single out (solo) specific Sectors of circles. Click the “X” on the right of the key to clear all filters and solos.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
	<h2>Year</h2>
	<p>The circles display data for a specific year in the dataset. By changing the year using the slider at the bottom of the app, the data associated with each circle will change to that new year’s data. This, in conjunction with using the play button to cycle through years, can provide helpful insights on how the data changes over time.</p>
