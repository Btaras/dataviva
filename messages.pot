This number is then normalized by dividing it by the sum of all items regardless of its %(rca)s in location b. In speaking about exports, we would notice that if a particular product is connected mostly with products that a location does export, the distance value would be close to 0 (meaning it’s very close by!). The opposite being true if the interested product is connected with mostly products that are not exported, i.e. the distance value would be closer to 1. The equation can be found in this figure."

When viewing a specific Brazilian location, one is only seeing the products that said location is exporting. The way proximity is calculated for products is by counting the number of locations that export both products with revealed comparative advantage (%(rca)s) and dividing that by the number of locations that export the most ubiquitous product of the pair.

Take for example two large industries such as auto part manufacturing and electronics manufacturing. The data has shown that such large industries do not tend to co-locate in similar areas, but instead in rural areas outside of urban centers isolated from many other industries.

If this number is larger than or equal to 1, we can say that Belo Horizonte is a strong exporter in Cars (stronger than the average).
